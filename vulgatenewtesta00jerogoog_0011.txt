and deuout persons, and like 10 take much good, and no harma thereb .
Which rescript, though in these daies 01 000011000 001 be so precisely
obseruari as 10 other times & places, where there is 10000 (100 respecto 01

Councels‚ reason, and religion do require.’' They warmly deny that our
forefathers “suffered euery schole-meister, scholer, or Grammarian that
had 0 little Greekc or Latin straight 1ο take in hand the holy Testament:
or that the translated Bibles into the vulgar tanges, were in the handes
01 euery husbandmen, artificer, prentioe, boies, girles, mistresse, maide,
man: that they were sung, plaied, alleaged, 01 euery tinker, tauerner,
rimer, minstrel: that they were 100 table talke, 100 alebenches, 100 1100100
and berges, and 100 euery prophane person and companie. No, in those
better times men were neither 00 111, 00000 curicus of 111010 001000, so to
abuse the blessed books 01 Christ: neither was there any such easy 0100000
before printing was inuented, to disperse the copies into the hands of euery
man, 00 now 111000 10.” The Scriptures, they add, were then in
monasterias, collegae, churches; in bishops', priests', and some other
devout principal leymen’s houses and hands—and curiously remark that,
“the poore ploughman could then, in· labouring the ground, sing the
hymns and psalms, either in knowen or vnknowen languages, as they
heard them in the holy church‚ though they could neither reade nor
know 1110 00000, meaning, and mysterics 01 1110 00100.” Under cover 01 the
authority 01 Augustine and Chrysostom, they deprecate, 00 00 abuse,
the practice 01 011 indiffereutly reading, expounding, and talking 01 the
Scripture; and urge, that some 000 10 10000, and some to teach; that the
people went 001 up to talk with God 10 the mountain, but Moses, Aaron,
and Eleazar. They repudiate the idea that it is from envy that the priests
kee the holy book from the people, and ascribe the wholesome restriction
to 1110 wisdom and mercy 01 1110 Ohurch. “She would haue the vnworth
