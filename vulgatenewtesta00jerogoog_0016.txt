Whitgift.¹ Dr. William Fulke, Master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge,
one of those who had signed the letter to Cartwright, finding, perhaps,
that his learned contemporary was not likely to complete his labours, or,
thinking that answers from different pens might not be undesirable,
published, in 1583, “A Defence of the Sincere and True Translation of
the Holy Scriptores into the English Tongue against the manifold cavils,
frivolous quarrels, and impudent slanders, of Gregorio Martin.” six

Confutation of all such Argumenta, Glosses, ahd Annotations, as contain
manifest Impiety or Heresy, Treoson and Slander against the Catholio
Church of God, and the true Teachers thereos 3 or the Translations used
in the Church of England.'’ Though the learned Cartwright was
interrupted at the beginning of his work, he afterwards pursned it;
and it was published after his death by his friends, in 1618 ; “ A book,”
says Fuller, “ which, notwithstanding some defeots, is so complete, that
the Rhemish durat never return the least answer thereto 3⁷² and in
another place, he says of it, “No English champion in that age did
with more valour or success charge and rout the Rhemish enemy in
matters of doctrine.'’
