teaching of the church. In fact, the translatore sent forth the Scriptures
as explained by tradition, treating them as dubious oracles, whose
utterances were not to be properly understood without the aid of an
interpreting priesthood.

That the Rhemish translatore were men of learning there can be no
question. Indeed, they might be said to be more thau qualified for their
taslr, for to translate correctly from the Vulgate required no very great
erudition. They scrupulously adhered to the principles laid down in
their preface3 and often, at the expense of English idiom and of common
sense, refused to “mollify” the Latin, and strictly followed it word for
word. The following version affords an instance3 “ Dol minde accord·
ing to the flesh that there be with me, Itis and Itis not? But God is
faithful, because our preaching which was to you there is not in it, It is,
and It is aot. For the Sonne of God Jesus Christ, who by us was
preached among you, by me and Syluanus and Timotheo, was not, Itis,
and Itis not, but, Itis, was in him for al the promises of God that are,
in him It is, therefore also by him‚,Ameu to God, vnto our glorie.''—-

(2 cor. 1. w-ao.)

It would be unfair to charge the Rhemish translatore with a dis·

honest perversion of Scripture; it is sufficient condemnation, and one
which they deserve—indeed, one which, in their preface, they seem
almost to court—to affirm, that they produced a version inmany parts
quite unintelligible-“a translation,'' to use the quaint phrase of F uller,
“needing to be translated.''' The words “pasche'’ “azymes,’' “neophyta”
&c., remind us of Gardiner’s “majestic words,” and the whole work was
executed in such a manner as would have met his views. To leave them
untranslated, and then give the explanation of them in the annotatione,
was to veil the ScriptureS, that the Church might come forward and
disclose her mysteries,—to silence the voice of inspiration that she might
speak herself. ln short, the motto of the Rhemists was not, “ Search the
ScriptureS,'' but, “fleur the Charch'' and they had honesty enough to avow
it. The (lhief importunae and, interest connected with this version, arise
from the veneration with which it is regarded by our Roman Catholic
countrymen3 and it may be remarked that, disguised as are many'of the
renderings, and notwithstanding the formidablc array of annotatione,
