of every prouince aud people, according 10 the differencc of time, place,
and persons, how and in what sort the reading of the Scripturcs is more
or lesse to be procured or permitted.” They explain away the sanction
11101 Chrysostom gives to the popular reading of the Bihle3 allego that
the peoplc were fonder of the mysteries than of the 1001010 01 Christianity3
and remark, 11101 every heretic quotes Scriptura for his heresy. They
then charge the Protestauts with falsely translating the word of God, and
set forth, in contrast, their own religicus care and sincerity. The reason
for introducing the annotatione follows; and, in 0 few lines, the great
principle of their Church is developed. “We haue also set forth reason·

They afterwards exhibitio arraythe reasons for their preferring the
Vulgate text. It is most ancient, was corrected by Jeromc3 commended
by Augustino, used by the Fathers3 defined as exclusivcly authentic by
the Counoil 01 Τ1001; 10 most grave3 least partial; precise 10 following

much diversity and dissension3 and not only better than all other Latin

they disagree. They then give two or three instances in which the
F athers thought that the true reading 01 the passage wasto be found in
the Latin text, and that the Greek was corrupted ; and, as a still more
decisive proof 01 the superiority 01 the Latin vulgate, they state the fact,
that “ the Calvinists'' had often preferred it to the Greek. '

Advancing 1ο 01111001 grounds, they argue thot the Latin commonly
agrees with the Greek text3 that if it differs from the usual readings of
