which stand like sentinels to defend the Church against attacks from
without, and to keep the faithful within, there remain, after all, what is
quite sufficient to show the inconsistency of the Papal system with 1119
word of God, and to furnish 1119 thoughtful reader with weapons by
which to figbt his way out of the strongholds of error.

Unfortunately for the boasted and almost immaculate purity of the Latin
text, so strenuously maintained hythe Rhemish translatore, within eight
iteam after they had completed their labeum, a new edition of the

ulgate appeared, under 1119 pontifical sanction of Sixtus V, who, on
account of the many errors in the existing copies, found such an under·¹
taking to be necessary. The work thus ushered into the world by such
high and infallible authority, was found by 1119 next Pope 1ο be
exceedingly incorrect ; and another edition, differing, more than any other,
from the Sixtine, was published under the auspices of Glernent vlss, in
1592. Two Latin texts, varying in numerous particulars, were thus
placed before the Ohurch by two pontiffs of equal authority3 an awkward
circumstance for the advocates of the Rhemish version and papal infalli-
bility, which has not failed to attract the notice, and employ the exultiug
pens, of Protestants, especially of our learned countryman, Dr. Thomas
1111199.ι

In the same year that the Rhamish translation was published, Gregory
Martin, who had the chief· hand in its pre oration, published his
“ Discovery of 1119 Manifold Corruptions of the holte Scripturas by the
Heretikes of our daies,’' evidently intended as asort of appendix to the
version. The Protestants felt that these works required to be noticed;
and it hasbeen said, that Quaen Elizabeth sent to Beza, to request him
to undertake an answer to the objectionable matter contained in 1119
Rhemish translation, and that he modestly exoused himself, replying that
she had one in her own kingdom far abler than himself to undertake ⁴
such a task, namely, Mr. Thomas Cartwright. This divine, whose
reputation for learning stood very high, wasa Puritan, and an object of
great dislike to Arcbbishop Whitgift. Whether there be truth or not in
1119 statement that Elizabeth applied to Beza, and that Beza referred her
Majesty to Oartwright as a fitting champion in 1119 Protestant cause, it is
certain that Cartwright was excited to undertake the work by the
solicitation of Sir Francis Walsingham, and by a letter from several
Α learned men of the University of Cambridge. Cartwright began, and
