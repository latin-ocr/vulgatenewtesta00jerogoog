the Greek text, it coincides with some copy specified in the margin, of
which examples may be seen in Stephens's Greek Testameut; that the
adversaries admit some of these marginal readings to be preferable that
when Greek copies fail, quotations in the Greek F athers may be lound
consonant with the Vulgate3 that in default of authority there, recourse
may be had to conjectural emendation, to bring the Greek into harmony
with the Latin3 that if neither Greek F athers nor conjectures help us,
the Latin Fathars, with great consent, will easily justify the old Vulgar
translation, and, lastly, if some Latin F athera of ancient time read
otherwise, the cause is to be found in the great diversity and multitude
of Latin copies which then existed. On these very convenient principles
of criticism they prove, to their own satisfaction, that the old Vulgar
translation is as good, and even better, than the Greek text itself.

They further maintain that the Latin does not make more for them
than the Greek, but in some instances assiste their cause even less; and
candour must admit, that in the examples they cite this is the fact.

The manner of translating iy then defended; and they attempt a
vindication of certain untranslated terms, such as “ parasceue,” “ pasche,''
“azymas'’ “neophyta'’ In hard places they presume not “to mollify

John ii. 11. They sometimes add the Greek, and sometimes the Latin,
in the margin. They thus conclude their production :-“ Thus we haue
endeauoured by al maanes to satisfie the indifferent reader‚ and to helpe
his vnderstanding euery way, both in the text, and by Annotations:
and withal to deale most sincerely before God and man, in translating

The notes introduced in the margin throughout the volume are
chiefly controversial, and are intended to guard the render against the
adoption of any view ola passage inconsistent with the authoritative
